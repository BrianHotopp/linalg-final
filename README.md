In order to generate the plots, create a virtual environment in the project root using:

`python3 -m venv venv`

Install the project dependencies using:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Run the main program using:

`python3 main.py`

The plots should generate and a matplotlib window should appear on screen! Close the window to view the next plot!
